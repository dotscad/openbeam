# elbow_joint.scad

A variable elbow-joint for [OpenBeam](http://openbeamusa.com/).  Print and hook the
pieces together with an M6 bolt/nut.  I will eventually include a link to an M6 knob.

This is a work in progress and has not yet been printed/tested, which means that some
measurements are likely to be wrong.
